Add ideas for the project here.

Have + button to insert a new item. In the list view it will create a new item, in the menu view it will create a new list.
Pressing the + button will open a new screen on top of the present one (90% of screen, the other will be a little bit darkened).
The item screen will have an item name with autocomplete, quantity, size, type of package (box, bag, pieces, can, etc.), measurement unit ( ml, l, g, kg, m, m2). All fields with options will be spinners. All fields need to fit in one screen. No scrolling. Also an Add button at the bottom. All fields except the name are optional. If left blank, they will not appear in the menu.
The list screen will only have a name field.

Each item in the list will have the name on one row and the contents of the other fields in smaller font on the next row/s. 
Each row will have a button in the right side for editing.
Checking/unchecking will be done by tapping the item once. The state will be determined by the color of the cell (green for checked).

For consideration: we need a button that will do one of the following:
- move the checked items to the bottom (if we have color coding, leave the unchecked items at the top and order the others by color. the checked ones will still be last).
- hide the checked items. How do we bring them back?
- remove checked items from list. Isn't this too definitive? It might be a mistake.



Ideas for further development:
- long press for a ”yellow” state. Might mean ”I will get these items”. Since the list will be shared, we might need to have some color coding for people (red is Mary, yellow is John).
